# Legth Converter
Length converter is a personal project. It has been completed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python Flask. 

The web application allows the user to convert to and from 8 length units. 

The application is simple and easy to use. 
On the main page is the actual converter, which has an input box to enter the value and a selection menu which allows the user to select the inputs' value unit and has an output box which shows the computation result and the user can also choose the unit that the input should be converted to.
The main page also contains an information button which, if pressed, will load another page which displays explanation on how to use the application.

JavaScript allows to display the value in real-time (i.e: as soon as a key is pressed), therefore there is no need to have another button to compute the value. The result of the entered value is changed if any of the units change, without having to refresh the page. 

## Run locally

   execute FLASK_APP=converter.py

```
